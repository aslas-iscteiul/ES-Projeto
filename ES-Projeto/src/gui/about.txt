BeQoS is an app developed within an academic project for Software Engineering. It allows its users to evaluate de quality of some 
methods, detecting the defects present in the original evaluation of said methods. It does so by showing an interface that 
gives the user two options for the calculations, either using a tool or a rule. Through a series of queeries, the application knows
what the final rule is and counts the types of defects (or correct original evaluations) on the Excel file given to us.
When developing this application we tried our best to be conscious of the user experience and make sure that it would be easy to 
understand and "user-friendly".
